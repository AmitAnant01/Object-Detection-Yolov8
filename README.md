# 🧠✅ YOLOv8 Smart Object Detector and Counter 🎥 with Open CV

This is a real-time object detection and counting project using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.
It detects different types of objects in a video and counts them only when they cross a virtual line (useful for traffic, people counting). This project will basically helps in the detection of objects where we can use it to identify that object which is what exactly.


## 🚀 Key Features Included here 

#### ✅ Detects objects in real-time using YOLOv8
#### ✅ Counts objects only when they cross a fixed line

#### ✅ Shows FPS, object names, counts, and timestamp on screen
#### ✅ Uses different colors for each object type
#### ✅ We need to load the  any .mp4 video file it will start detection the object which are present inside them 
#### ✅ Uses a light and fast model yolov8n.pt by default


       

# 💡 Where we can use:

#### 🚦 Smart traffic monitoring during the defferent runnig of the vehicles 

#### 🧍 Counting people crossing a line that how many people have crossed the way 

#### 🚗 Vehicle entry and exit tracking whether the vehicles whichever passing through the particular place that is exactly objects or not 

#### 🅿 Smart parking system to identify the objects 

#### 🎥 Surveillance and security camera analytics


In the project majority of the objects detected which are car and person. But based on your object detection requirements you can add multiple of the objects whichever you want to detect such as bus, truck, dog, etc.



## 📝 Example Output (CSV)
- Output you will get whenever it's should detect somthing.

Timestamp             | Object Name | Total C 
----------------------------------------------
2025-06-29 14:01:10     | person      | 1
2025-06-29 14:01:12     | car         | 1
2025-06-29 14:01:15     | person      | 2
